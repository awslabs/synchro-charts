Accessibility is a concern that the team takes seriously and plans to improve upon, but it has not yet been tackled in development.

- Colors are WCAG AA Compliant.
- Charts are not fully keyboard accessible - some gestures are mouse only.
- Data visualized within a chart is not screen reader friendly.
- Annotations, tooltips, and legends are all screen reader friendly.
