**WARNING** synchro-charts is now deprecated (final release was v7.2.0)

we are now building `iot-app-kit-visualizations` to provide components for [iot-app-kit](https://github.com/awslabs/iot-app-kit)

### What is IoT App Kit Visualizations?

IoT App Kit Visualizations is a collection of time-series visualization components with a focus on operational use cases such as monitoring, root cause analysis, and basic analytics.

IoT App Kit Visualizations makes it easy to navigate a large amount of time-series data fluidly via intuitive gestures, synchronized across corresponding widgets.

IoT App Kit Visualizations has first class concepts of aggregation types, associated alarm status, allowing for an integrated experience when dealing with data which has corresponding status information.

IoT App Kit Visualizations is open sourced, you can contribute at [IoT App Kit Visualizations Github](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-synchro-charts).
